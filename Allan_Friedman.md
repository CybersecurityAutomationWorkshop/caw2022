Dr. Allan Friedman is Senior Advisor and Strategist
at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
He coordinates the global cross-sector community efforts around
software bill of materials (SBOM) and related vulnerability initiatives,
and works to advance their adoption inside the US government.
He was previously the Director of Cybersecurity Initiatives at NTIA,
leading pioneering work on vulnerability disclosure, SBOM,
and other security topics.
Prior to joining the Federal government,
Friedman spent over a decade as a noted information security
and technology policy scholar at Harvard’s Computer Science department,
the Brookings Institution,
and George Washington University’s Engineering School.
He is the co-author of the popular text “Cybersecurity and Cyberwar:
What Everyone Needs to Know,” has a degree in computer science
from Swarthmore College and a PhD in public policy from Harvard University.  
He is quite friendly for a failed-professor-turned-technocrat.
