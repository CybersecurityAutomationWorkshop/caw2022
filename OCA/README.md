This directory is for drafting a proposal
to make the Cybersecurity Automation
a subproject of the
[Open Cybersecurity Alliance](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/) (OCA).

# Cybersecurity Automation SubProject (CASP) Charter

## 1. Project Name

Cybersecurity Automation SubProject (CASP)

## 2. Abstract
The OCA Cybersecurity Automation SubProject (CASP)
is comprised of global like-minded cybersecurity vendors, end users,
thought leaders and individuals
who are interested in cybersecurity automation.

It is a forum where products
from all vendors, researchers, and software publishers
can freely exchange information, insights, and reference implementations
via commonly developed code and tooling,
using mutually agreed upon technologies, specifications, and procedures.

## 3. Purpose and Scope
The reality of the current cyber threat landscape is daunting.
Attacks are becoming more frequent, more impactful, and more sophisticated.
Attackers make use of sophisticated tools operating at machine speed.

## 3. Purpose and Scope

CTI sharing communities and activities have evolved from efforts within government, to establish more government-wide situational awareness and now to sharing between government, critical infrastructure owners/operators, and commercial cybersecurity service providers to support mitigation of these shared cyber threats.  However, sharing traditional indicators of compromise (IOCs) is no longer effective against an ever increasingly sophisticated adversary.  It is imperative that we continue to evolve and mature as a global community to maintain a competitive advantage over our adversaries.

To that end the OCA IoB Working Group was established to bring key stakeholders in the CTI community together to collectively focus on patterns of behavior associated with malicious cyber activity.  By understanding “normal” and possibly malicious behaviors or patterns of activity in our networks we can develop innovative solutions that enable us to share behavior sets (aka sets of adversarial behaviors) amongst the CTI community.   These behavior sets and associated detection strategies will lead to more proactive detection, more effective mitigations and, through timely and actionable sharing,  more prevention.

## 4. Societal Benefits
End user organizations consistently face challenges with the integration of CTI in direct network defense operations. This is often due to the primary actionable shared data being Common Vulnerability Enumerations (CVEs) and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). While it is critical to ensure CVEs are mitigated and active IoCs are blocked, these actions by their very nature force a reactive posture to an ever increasing cyber threat. Larger organizations with robust threat hunting teams are able to interpret insights from CTI into more proactive actions but the transfer of this knowledge and capability is not widespread to all organizations and currently is not occurring at machine speed while the cyber threat advances in speed and scale.

By creating machine-readable IoB objects and reference implementation code to easily integrate representations of adversary behaviors, the IoB Working Group can provide rapid detection and response capabilities that can be readily accessible to all organizations and provide standardization amongst the vendor community who can help provide capability to smaller organizationsthat may not have the resources for advanced threat hunting teams. The overarching theme is to foster collaboration across and between organizations.

## 5. Relationship to Other Projects
By it's nature, CASP has relationships with many other
projects, including the other 4 OCA subprojects and
many OASIS Technical Committees
as well as other organizations.
For related activities, see the
[FAQ](./OCA-Automation-FAQ.md).

## 6. Repositories and Licenses
CASP expects to launch with one repository
for development of the Cybersecurity Automation Workshop.
The Cybersecurity Automation Workshop repository
will be under
the CC BY 4.0 open-source license
for non-code contributions
and is not forseen to contain software.

CASP may propose additional repositories in the future
and would seek OCA TSC approval before doing so.
Potential additional repositories may include:
* a CASP "awareness & adoption" website repository. To begin with the workshop repository will serve both for workshop logistics and promoting cybersecurity automation in general. But with time, these may be split into two websites.
* repos for any standards-track work products proposed for development.
E.g. an overarching CASP interworking requirements & conformance specification.
Some potential specification topics are included
[here](./ExampleSpecTopics.md)

Any proposed repositories would include a proposed license
(from approved OCA list).

this Cybersecurity Automation Workshop website.

## 8. Contributors
The [previous Cybersecurity Automation Workshop](http://www.cybersecurityautomationworkshop.org/Results/)
had over 100 participants from around the globe
and included participation from the
PACE, SBOM, OpenC2, OCA, CSAF,
VSM, Kestrel, stix-shifter, STIX/TAXII, TAC,
and CACAO communities.
It included 'sweat equity'from
'[24 organizations](http://www.cybersecurityautomationworkshop.org/SweatEquity/)'.

Initial technical contributors are expected to include:
