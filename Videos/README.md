# Videos
The following videos were prepared to bring all participants to a common
level of understanding prior to the workshop.
They are available as an YouTube playlist at {fillinhere}.

All videos are under 3 minutes and there are two types:
interfaces and participants.

The purpose of the interface videos is to define all the arrows in

The purpose of the participant videos is to educate everyone on how the
participant fits into the cybersecurity automation ecosystem and what
they are bringing to the workshop.

Neither type of videos are allowed to be promotional advertisements.
But logos are allowed and organizations are allowed to be proud
of their accomplishments.
You are allowed to tout your benefits - you are NOT allowed to disparage
your competitors.
If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all.
This is not a bake-off - it's a plug fest focusing on interoperation.
Promote automation, interoperation, and transparency.
Remember an incoming tide raises all boats.

## clean up later
At the last Workshop, participants created <3 min videos introducing themselves
and what they were bringing to the Workshop.
The intent is to do similar for this workshop with some changes:
- videos are to be made prior to 26-May
- videos will be compiled into a YouTube playlist
- playlist will be made available to participants 27-May
- videos will NOT be shown at Workshop. Participants should watch all the videos prior to the start of the Workshop.
