# University of Oslo Results

## What Contributed
The University of Oslo presented the [Threat Actor Context Ontology](https://github.com/oasis-open/tac-ontology) of the [OASIS Threat Actor Context Technical Committee (TAC TC)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tac) in support of cybersecurity automation and, in particular, the sense-making and decision-making processes of cyberspace defense as they are described in the [IACD framework](https://www.iacdautomate.org/). 

The core model of the TAC ontology is based on the [STIX 2.1 standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/stix-v2.1.pdf) and further augments it with other representations that describe components of the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) domain. An example concept that was presented is the [Threat Agent Library](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324091298_Threat_Agent_Library_Helps_Identify_Information_Security_Risks) developed by Tim Casey and Intel Corporation in 2007, which describes a threat actor type typology. Encoding the typology in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), we demonstrated the inference capability of the ontology that could derive the type of an adversary in near real-time.

The following video provides an introduction to the TAC ontology and how it consumes STIX data to provide us with searchable, shareable, and interoperable knoweldhe graphs of CTI as linked open data.

We further discussed how the TAC ontology could integrate with other open-source solutions (STIX shifter and Kestrel threat hunting language) and utilize open standards (OpenC2, CACAO, SBOM, VEX, CSAF) to address different cybersecurity use cases.

As an ad-hoc contribution, we briefed about the [CACAO](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cacao) security playbooks "standard" and presented use cases on how CACAO can orchestrate and automate cyberspace defense, also by utilizing STIX and TAXII, OpenC2, Kestrel, and the TAC ontology.

## Use Cases and Take Aways
The participants showed high interest in the inference capabilities of the Threat Actor Context ontology to derive new understandings pertinent to CTI and support human intelligence analysis and decision making. 

Another well-received aspect is the availability of a plethora of open source and closed source software that can consume the ontology and be used as knowledge management solutions.
