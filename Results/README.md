# Results

This was drafted prior to the workshop
to  predict results and  help prioritize
the day of the workshop.
It is in the process of being revised post-workshop based on how we did.

The Cybersecurity Automation Workshop was held
2-June-2022 at the
[AT&T Forum](https://policyforum.att.com/att-forum/)
in Washington, DC with
35? in-person participants
and over 100 participants on the web.
Participants were from x? countries on y? continents.

The results will be looked at from several dimensions:
- Keynotes
- Use Cases - what portions of what use cases was 'sweat equity' contributed to
- Standard Interface - need some name to call the alphabet soup on logo. Many are standards organizations, but not all. But all have the goal of vendor agnostic interfaces allowing plug&play between functional elements
- Contributing Companies/Agencies/Universities - what each of the sweat equity contributors benefited from the workshop
