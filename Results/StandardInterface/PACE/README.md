## What Contributed
*recap sweat equity was brought of interest to this effort,
can ref to sweat page*

HII brought a Posture Attribute Collection (PAC) prototype to the CAW, as described in our [results page](../../Orgs/HII/README.md).

## Use Cases
*Note which use cases were of interest*

HII's prototype demonstrated two specific PACE use cases (one formally documented by the PACE project, the other a notional use case developed by HII):

 - [Collect SBOM From
   Device](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE/blob/main/docs/UseCases/collect_sbom_from_device.md), using an OpenC2 SBOM Actuator Profile
 - Collect OS version from Device, using an OpenC2 Database Actuator Profile to access the osquery tool.

## Example Files
*Provide links to example files*

## Accomplishments
*Note what accomplished*

HII conducted a successful demonstration of using the OpenC2 language to implement Posture Attribute Collection (PAC) as a stepping stone to a more complete PACE implementation.

## Action Items
*Note what needs to be brought back to community*
