# Cybeats Sweat Equity


[Cybeats](https://www.cybeats.com/)
innovative security suites
give business leaders visibility and control
over the materials and technology in their products.
[SBOM Studio](https://www.cybeats.com/sbom-studio)
gives transparency into your softwareâ€™s reputation,
nature and popularity with cybersecurity insights
for the entire product lifecycle using SBOMs.

For the June 2022 Cybersecurity Automation Workshop,
Cybeats will provide software tools, infrastructure support,
and in-person participation.

Cybeats SBOM Studio will be used to demonstrate
[Posture Attribute Collection & Evaluation (PACE) use cases.](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE/tree/main/docs/UseCases)
Since the PACE OpenC2 interfaces are still being defined,
liberal use of the hand-waving lycan will be used
to convert from the PACE interface to the Cybeats APIs.

The use cases which will be demonstrated are:
* [Command inserting SBOM into PACE system (SBOM Studio)](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE/blob/main/docs/UseCases/collect_sbom_with_command.md)
* [Command retrieving original SBOM from PACE system (SBOM Studio)](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE/blob/main/docs/UseCases/retrieve_sbom.md#retrieve-sbom-as-provided)
* [Command retrieving converted SBOM (eg SPDX to CycloneDX) from PACE system (SBOM Studio](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE/blob/main/docs/UseCases/retrieve_sbom.md#formatserialization-conversions)
* Command requesting posture evaluation of a CVE (eg log4shell) returning which products contain the component affected by the CVE (eg log4j)
* Command requesting posture evaluation of an SBOM returning vulnerabilities and licensing policy violations
* Command requesting posture evaluation comparing SBOMs from two versions of a product, returning the security posture difference between the the two versions - eg which vulnerabilities were fixed
