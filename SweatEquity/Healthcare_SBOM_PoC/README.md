# Healthcare SBOM PoC Sweat Equity

The Healthcare SBOM PoC consists of Health Delivery Organizations (HDOs),
Medical Device Manufacturers (MDMs), government officials
from several countries, and interested security professionals.
A proof of concept (PoC) has been running for several years.
Phase 1 proved the value of providing SBOMs.
Phase 2 expanded the number of participants
(8 HDO’s consuming SBOMs from 7 MDM’s)
and began exploring VEXs as well.
Phase 3 is just beginning.

The sweat equity that is being provided includes example
SBOMs, VEXs, Use Cases and even a How-to Guide.
Diagrams show how the PoC follows the general “PACE” workflow.
Unfortunately due to the conditions of the PoC NDA,
actual systems and artifacts can not be demonstrated –
just discussed in general terms.

Representing the Healthcare SBOM PoC will be Ed Heierman of Abbott,
Ed created the sweat equity material, but it represents the work of many
contributors.
