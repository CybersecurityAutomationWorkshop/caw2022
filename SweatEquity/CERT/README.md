CERT Sweat Equity

CERT provides
[SwiftBOM](https://democert.org/sbom/)
a tool for humans to create SBOM manually.
It is a particularly useful tool for those learning about SBOM.
An example SBOM is included.
SwiftBOM currently generates SBOM in
SPDX, CycloneDX and SWID formats.
A tree graph is also generated by SwiftBOM
that can be downloaded as a PNG file to quickly visualize
relationships between components in an SBOM,
including vulnerabilities highlighted in red.


The source code is open source at
https://github.com/CERTCC/SBOM/tree/master/SwiftBOM .

See the CERT video for more info.
