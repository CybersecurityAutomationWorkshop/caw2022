# HII - Sweat Equity

[HII](https://hii.com/) [Mission
Technologies](https://hii.com/capabilities/mission-technologies//)
provides contractor support to DoD for [Open Command and Control
(OpenC2)](https://openc2.org) standardization and general
cybersecurity automation, with a focus on the development of
[OpenC2
specifications](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2#technical)
and [associated
tooling](https://github.com/orgs/oasis-open/repositories?q=openc2&type=all&language=&sort=).

For the June 2022 CAW, HII will provide software tools,
infrastructure support, and in-person participation:

 * OpenC2 Integration Framework (OIF): the OIF provides a pre-built OpenC2 ecosystem for testing actuator profiles, transfer specifications, and actuator implementations:
   * [Orchestrator](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-orchestrator) -- an OpenC2 Producer
   * [Device](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-device) -- an OpenC2 Consumer
 * [Yuuki](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-device) -- an OpenC2 Proxy for rapid development of OpenC2 actuators


 * In support of communications among plugfest participants, HII hosts two publish / subscribe message brokers on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
   * MQTT (supporting use of the OpenC2 [MQTT Transfer Specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/transf-mqtt/v1.0/transf-mqtt-v1.0.html))
   * OpenDXL (a commonly used platform in the cyber defense product space; there is not an OpenC2 transfer specification for OpenDXL, although aspects of the MQTT Transfer Specification [e.g., topic structure] could be applied to OpenDXL)
  
HII operates a Discord server that has been used for coordination
during past virtual CAW events. Access details for the message
brokers is available in a pinned message on our [Discord
#plugfest
channel](https://discord.com/channels/438045507462365184/). If
you are not a member of our Discord, contact one of the HII
participants for an invitation or to be sent the information
directly. Specifics for the process of connecting to the brokers
is linked from the [CAW June 2022 Tech Details
page](https://www.cybersecurityautomationworkshop.org/TechDetails/).
 

HII also plans to participate in demonstrations of interoperability for 
[Posture Attribute Collection & Evaluation (PACE)](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE) use cases, 
under the [Open Cybersecurity Alliance's (OCA)](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/) PACE subproject,
based on development progress achieved prior to the CAW event.
