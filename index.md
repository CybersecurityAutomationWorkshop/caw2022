# Cybersecurity Automation Workshop

```markdown
**Under Construction**

```

The next Cybersecurity Automation Workshop
will be held 2-June-2022 at the
[AT&T Forum](https://policyforum.att.com/att-forum/)
in Washington, DC.

## Agenda
Schedule is tentatively 9AM-5PM 2-June-2022;
details are still being worked.

Feedback from the last workshop recommended spreading the
keynotes throughout the day
(last time they were all in the kickoff session).
Although a detailed agenda still needs to be created,
the intent will be spread out the keynotes as recommended.

See [Agenda](./Agenda.md) for more details.

## Venue
The [AT&T Forum](https://policyforum.att.com/att-forum/)
is located at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001.

Thank you to AT&T for hosting the event for us.

## Remote Access
Intent is to allow virtual participation.
It may not apply to all sessions or all interoperation demonstrations.

Details need to be worked out yet.

## Keynotes
keynote speakers have been lined up.
Eventually add them here or make a subtending page.

## Eligibility
Open to all.
Free.
Registration will be required.

Should we reach limits (if any)
on the number of physical attendees,
some sort of rules will need to be worked out,
well in advance,
on who is eligible to attend.
Rules would probably
be based on sweat equity, distance traveled,
and a quota (ie to spread attendance across the orgs involved).


## Registration
Participation will require registration.
Details forthcoming.

## Participating Organizations
Strictly speaking none
(ie workshop is a collection of individuals
getting together to understand and get stuff interoperating
for the common good).

But the individuals will be (potentially?)
bringing together the work of the following:
- [PACE](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE)
- [OpenC2](openc2.org)
- TAC
- CACAO
- SBOM
- LF SPDX
- OWASP CycloneDX
- CASF

the above committed. add the others as they commit or now?
- CTI/STIX/TAXII
- LF Daggerboard
- OCA Ontology
- OCA stixshifter
- OCA Kestrel
- IETF MUD
- ...

To learn more how the work of these organizations
will be specifically used in this workshop,
see
[OrgMashup](./OrgMashup/README.md)

## Objective, Goals, Focus
Still early in planning stages so this needs work

Attendees should walk away feeling
that they have had a positive engagement
with their peers
and have more confidence
cybersecurity automation
is in a better state.

Objectives include: blah blah

Goals are: blah blah

Focus: demonstrating working interoperating
systems contributing to cybersecurity automation.

## Sweat Equity
To learn more about what participants are bringing
to the workshop, see
[Sweat Equity](./SweatEquity/README.md)

## Technical Details for Interoperation
see
[TechDetails](./TechDetails/README.md)
for more details on decisions being made on how to get
stuff to work together.


## Governance
This workshop is being organized by one passionate individual volunteer
who was unelected and will be running it on the
D-cubed model (Duncan/democratic/dictator).

## Code of Conduct
TL;DR - don't be a jerk.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment,
we as organizers and participants
pledge to making participation in our projects and our community
a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
or sexual identity and orientation.

See [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
for the complete code of conduct.

## Demo Use Cases
In the ideal world,
the workshop would perform a live demonstrate 
one complicated use case
that evolved from quiet to under attack
touching many different child use cases
involving all the orgs and all the participants.

Being the real world, and early in our
cybsersecurity automation
journey,
the workshop will involve a series of
demonstrations - some live, some tabletop -
touching various interworking scenarios.
And they probalby won't all work,
so a certain amount of hackathon will also
be taking place to add missing lycans or
fixing bugs so that interworking can occur.

More details on exactly is planned is at
[DemoUseCases](./DemoUseCases/README.md)

## Results
Eventually results will be put
[here](./Results/README.md)
