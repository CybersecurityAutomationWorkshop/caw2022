## Pre Workshop Homework Assignments
- [use cases](./DemoUseCases/#4-interoperability-demos) developed for all planned interoperations that will take place
- [Videos](./Videos/README.md) prepared by 26-May
- all participants watch all the [Videos](./Videos/README.md) prior to workshop so they are familiar with the interfaces and the participants


## clean this up
The remaining time will be spent either:
- demonstrating interworking parts/all of a use case
   + the hope is much of the details will be worked out prior to the Workshop as to what systems will interoperate on which use case(s)
- trouble shooting interworking
- hackathon to create new lycans or modify interfaces in the spirit of addine new interworking scenarios.



Single or multiple track is not yet decided and will depend on
the number and extent of the interworking scenarios.

Prior to 2-June:
- use cases established
- interworking scenarios defined including use cases, systems, interfaces, and participants
- participant videos created and viewed
